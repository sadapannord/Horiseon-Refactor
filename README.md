# Horiseon Project Refactor

## Description

In this project I worked on cleaning up the code for the Horiseon website. The CSS contained multiple redundant declarations, and the HTML contained many non-semantic elements. 

In working through this refractor I learned how to identify unnecessary elements and how to tidy up code. By commenting on what the code was supposed to do I gained a deeper understanding of how it works.
